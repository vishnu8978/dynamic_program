# dynamic_program

overview : 

This project aim is to find the longest common substring when two strings are compared.And Moreover this project uses dynamic programming
to build lookup table and also it helps to determine the actual substring which shared by both substrings.

Time Complexity: O(m × n), where m and n are the lengths of the two strings.

Space Complexity: O(m × n), due to the DP table.
